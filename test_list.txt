There are several evidence-based questionnaires and assessments used to evaluate various mental health conditions. These questionnaires are designed to provide insights into a person's mental health and are commonly used by healthcare professionals and researchers. Here are some well-known ones:

These questionnaires are widely used in clinical settings and research studies to assess mental health conditions and monitor treatment progress.
